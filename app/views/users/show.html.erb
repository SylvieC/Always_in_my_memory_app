            <p>The pile consisting of <strong>5</strong> cards is the pile you work on every learning session.<br> After a card has been viewed a minimum of 15 times, it it directed to the "Things I have learned" pile. It is then replaced by a new card from the "things I want learn" pile. <small>The cycle described above starts only after the initial pile has been viewed 15 times. From that time on, all the cards in the pile have been viewed 15 times. This allows the process of adding and retrieving cards to start since the first card can only be taken away after having been view 15 times.</p>

        The reason for this is that no card can be taken from the pile if it hasn't been viewed a minimum of 15 times</p>

        <h3>After the 15th viewing of the pile : the regular flow of cards starts</h3>
        <p class="center steps">After that, each time  you will have viewed a pile three times, the pile will be updated: the top card will be removed, and another card will be added to the bottom of the pile. And the process will repeat itself, as long as there are cards in the reserve pile.<br/> 
        <small>Every card that will be removed will have been viewed a minimum of 15 times, which is known to be a number of times to remember well.</small>
