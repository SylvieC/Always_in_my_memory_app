            <p>The pile consisting of <strong> s    5</strong> cards where you view the cards.<br> After a card has been viewed a minimum of 15 times, it it directed to the "Things I have learned" pile. It is then replaced by a new card from the "things I want learn" pile. <small>The cycle described above starts only after the initial piles is viewed 15 times. From that time on, all the cards in the pile have been viewed 15 times. This allows the process of adding and retrieving cards to start since the first card can only be taken away after having been view 15 times.</p>
